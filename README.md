## About Feed For Life

Feed For Life is a web platform built to make food donation easier and more organized. It connects donors who want to share food with volunteers ready to help distribute it, contributing towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #2: Zero Hunger.

The platform is created using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) along with Tailwind CSS for styling. It uses React-Redux for managing app state and Cloudinary to handle image uploads.
